# Transpose

R Shiny app to translate text across languages, and show alignment. The project was funded by the AHRC Creative Multilingualism group ![](https://www.eurolitnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/creative-multilingualism-logo.jpg)

Full instructions are provided on the front page. The app may be accessed [here](https://nickriches.shinyapps.io/transpose_shiny/), but please bear in mind that as this is a free account here may be usage restrictions.

Please also note that to run properly you need to obtain an API key from Google to access its translation services. See [this site](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key), and [this site](https://blog.weglot.com/google-translate-api-key/). The name of the key needs to entered into the `app.R` code (look for the location in the code which refers to a ".json" file) and it needs to be stored in the same directory as this file.
